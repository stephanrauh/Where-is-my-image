Here's how you can get started with Docker on Windows:

**Installation Options**
You have two main paths: Docker Desktop (recommended for most users) or Docker Engine on WSL2. Docker Desktop provides a GUI and handles the complexity for you, while WSL2 gives you a more Linux-native experience.

**Getting Docker Desktop**
Download Docker Desktop from docker.com and install it. You'll need Windows 10/11 Pro, Enterprise, or Education for Hyper-V support, or you can use WSL2 backend on Windows 10/11 Home. The installer will guide you through enabling required features.

**Key Concepts to Grasp**
Since you have ops experience, focus on understanding containers vs VMs - containers share the OS kernel and are much lighter. Images are read-only templates, containers are running instances of images. The Dockerfile defines how to build an image.

**Essential Commands to Learn**
Start with these core commands:
- `docker run` - create and start containers
- `docker build` - build images from Dockerfiles  
- `docker ps` - list running containers
- `docker images` - list available images
- `docker exec` - run commands in running containers

**Practical First Steps**
Pull and run a simple image like `docker run hello-world` to verify your setup. Then try running a web server: `docker run -p 8080:80 nginx` and access it at localhost:8080. This demonstrates port mapping, a crucial concept.

**Windows-Specific Considerations**
Docker Desktop runs containers in a Linux VM, so you're actually running Linux containers. For Windows containers, you need to switch Docker Desktop to Windows mode, but Linux containers are more common and have better ecosystem support.

**Networking and Volumes**
Learn Docker's networking modes and how to persist data with volumes. Windows path mounting works but uses different syntax than Linux - use forward slashes even on Windows.

Your ops background will help with understanding logging, monitoring, and troubleshooting. The transition should be smooth once you grasp the containerization paradigm.
