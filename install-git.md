**Download Git for Windows**
Go to git-scm.com and download the official Git for Windows installer. This includes Git Bash, Git GUI, and shell integration.

**Installation Process**
Run the installer as administrator. You'll encounter several configuration screens:

- **Editor choice**: Select your preferred text editor (Vim, Notepad++, VS Code, etc.)
- **PATH environment**: Choose "Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software" for maximum compatibility
- **HTTPS transport backend**: Use OpenSSL unless you have specific requirements for Windows Secure Channel
- **Line ending conversions**: Select "Checkout Windows-style, commit Unix-style line endings" for cross-platform compatibility
- **Terminal emulator**: MinTTY provides better experience than Windows Console
- **Git Pull behavior**: Choose "Default (fast-forward or merge)" unless you prefer rebasing

**Post-Installation Configuration**
Open Command Prompt or PowerShell and configure your identity:
```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

**Verify Installation**
Check the installation:
```bash
git --version
```

**Optional Enhancements**
Consider installing a GUI client like GitHub Desktop, SourceTree, or GitKraken if you prefer graphical interfaces. For credential management, Git Credential Manager is included and handles authentication with GitHub, GitLab, etc.

**Integration with IDEs**
Most Windows IDEs (Visual Studio, VS Code, IntelliJ) will automatically detect the Git installation and integrate it into their interfaces.

The installer creates Start Menu entries for Git Bash (Unix-like terminal) and Git GUI if you need them.
